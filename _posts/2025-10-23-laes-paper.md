The paper I am currently working on is on stellar feedback in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, using observations from the MUSE instrument on the Very Large Telescope. This work provides new insights into how young massive stars drive galactic winds in the early universe.

Using gravitationally-lensed Lyman-α emitting galaxies observed behind galaxy clusters, we discovered evidence for **delayed onset of supernova feedback** in extremely young starbursts. Here's what we found:

## Key Findings

### 1. Ubiquitous Outflows
Nearly all galaxies in our sample show signatures of outflows, either through:
- Redshifted Lyman-α peaks relative to the systemic velocity
- Blueshifted metal absorption lines indicating gas moving toward us at high velocities

### 2. Two Populations with Different Ages
Galaxies split into two groups based on their Lyman-α profiles:
- **Double-peaked sources**: Extremely young (~4 Myr old) with weaker, slower outflows
- **Single-peaked sources**: Older (~10-15 Myr) with stronger, faster, more turbulent outflows

This age difference aligns remarkably well with the expected onset of core-collapse supernovae from the most massive stars.

### 3. Clumpy Outflow Structure
Analysis of metal absorption line ratios reveals that outflows consist of optically-thick clumps of gas rather than smooth, homogeneous shells. Both neutral and ionized gas phases show evidence of clumpiness.

### 4. Model Limitations
While simple expanding shell models can reproduce Lyman-α profiles well, they systematically overestimate systemic redshifts and can yield unphysical parameters—a cautionary tale for interpreting model fits.

## Why this Matters

This work provides one of the first empirical constraints on feedback timescales in early universe galaxies. The ~4 Myr transition we observe has important implications for:
- Models of early galaxy formation and evolution
- Understanding how feedback regulates star formation
- Predictions for metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium

## The Sample

Our study analyzed **338 Lyman-α emitters** at redshifts 2.9 < z < 6.7, taking advantage of gravitational lensing by foreground galaxy clusters to boost the signal and detect faint spectral features that would otherwise be invisible.

*Stacked metal absorption profiles for single-peaked (red) and double-peaked (blue) Lyman-α sources. Single-peaked sources show significantly stronger and broader absorption, indicating more massive and turbulent outflows driven by supernova feedback.*

## What's Next?

JWST observations of these same lensing clusters will enable robust stellar mass measurements, helping us distinguish whether double-peaked sources evolve into single-peaked systems as feedback strengthens, or whether they represent fundamentally different galaxy populations.
