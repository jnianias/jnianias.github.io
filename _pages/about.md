I am a researcher in observational astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Hong Kong. My research focuses primarily on stellar feedback in the early universe, in particular outflows of gas driven out of galaxies by energetic processes associated with young stars (supernovae, stellar winds, radiation pressure etc.). The overarching goal of my research is to better understand how galaxies grow and evolve, helping to explain the properties of galaxies in the present day.
